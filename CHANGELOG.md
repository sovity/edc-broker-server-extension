### Deployment Migration Notes

1. There are new **required** configuration properties:
    ```yaml
    # List of Data Space Names for special Connectors (default: '')
    EDC_BROKER_SERVER_KNOWN_DATASPACE_CONNECTORS: "Mobilithek=https://some-connector/ids/data,OtherDataspace=https://some-other-connector/ids/data"
    ```
2. There are new **optional** configuration properties available for overriding:
    ```yaml
    # Parallelization for Crawling (default: 3)
    EDC_BROKER_SERVER_NUM_THREADS: 16
   
    # Default Data Space Name (default: MDS)
    EDC_BROKER_SERVER_DEFAULT_DATASPACE: MDS
  
    # Maximum number of Data Offers per Connector (default: 50)
    EDC_BROKER_SERVER_MAX_DATA_OFFERS_PER_CONNECTOR: 50
    
    # Maximum number of Contract Offers per Data Offer (default: 10)
    EDC_BROKER_SERVER_MAX_CONTRACT_OFFERS_PER_DATA_OFFER: 10
   
    # Pagination Configuration: Catalog Page Size (default: 20)

    ```
3. An issue prevented the keystore file from being read, preventing a successful data space log in.
4. Added a reference to [connector/.env](connector/.env) as source for other possible broker server configuration
   options, that have defaults, but might have use cases for overriding.
